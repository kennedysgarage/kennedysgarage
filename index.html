    <h2>Hello</h2>
  </div><!--/col-->
  <div class="col-9">
    <p>My name is Kennedy and I am a naively optimistic entrepreneur. When I am not building my own products I am hired as a UX strategist &amp; mobile UI designer. I live full time in NYC, but I can often be found in SF for my clients out West. My side hobby is real estate, so I occasionally spend time in Florida near where I grew up. When I am not working I enjoy spending time surfing, motorcycles, eating cookies, continuing my self-education, and drinking coffee.</p>

    <p>I have with worked with powerful brands such as Google, Wine Spectator, Porsche, Spotify, Citi, IBM, Victoria's Secret, MLB, and WeWork. Becuase of this I can not publicly share some of my more recent work, either because the products have not launched or I am under some kind of contract. Thanks for understanding.</p>
