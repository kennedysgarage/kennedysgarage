      <p>When I was building <a href="/beachhair/">Beach Hair</a> I needed to include a PAO Symbol on the label. I looked around for a while and had no luck finding a vector version of it. So I did want any creative would do. I created it and then shared it with the public to use. I also included the vector on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-after-opening_symbol">Wikipedia page</a> about to future other others.</p>

  <c span=6 span-s=row>
    <p>Every website starts with a domain, so I purchased <a href="http://paosymbol.com">paosymbol.com</a>. The website is dead simple, I wanted to let people know what the site was for and the direct link to download it.</p>
