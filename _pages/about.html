      <p class="intro"><strong>C.M. Kennedy</strong> is a designer raised on saltwater and gasoline. He grew up building motorcycles and cars with his father, and every free moment he had was spent surfing.</p>
      <p class="intro">The tragic events of 9/11 occurred during his sophomore year of high school, which compelled him to join the Air Force, where he proudly served as an Aerospace Maintenance Technician. After his honorable discharge, he spent his time building MySpace pages and worked as an EMT while trying to figure out what was next.</p>
      <p class="intro">In 2009 he moved to NYC to work for MLB Advanced Media, where he led the digital design efforts for the Florida Marlins. He then spent the next decade building his own products and successfully launching products for companies such as Google, Citi Bank, and WeWork. He currently resides in SF and is actively searching for a full-time role where he can offer his design and leadership experience to a growing company.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

  <c span=1-5 span-s=row>
    <p class="intro">The original Kennedy&#8217;s Garage was opened by my grandfather Theron Kennedy in Lake of the Ozark, Missouri, on February 28th, 1941.</p>
    <p class="intro">Although 1941 was a different time and the business was building cars, nothing has changed as far as working hard. The key to his success was the long term relationships that he developed with his customers and the community. Today I still value those traditions and enjoy the old fashioned handshake. The original Kennedyâ€™s Garage was shut down after the passing of Theron. I later reclaimed the name and wanted to keep the same values as my grandfather. Since then, the family has moved away from building cars, but we still have a deep passion for them.</p>
