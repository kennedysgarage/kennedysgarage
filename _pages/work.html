    <h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gadbaw/">Benjamin Gadbaw</a></h4>
    <p>Service Designer at WeWork<br/>January 4th, 2017</p>

    <p>Even as a team lead Kennedy takes responsibility for execution on everything from design work (two native iOS apps in the last year) to resolving operational issues (fixing wifi, troubleshooting remote video conferencing, signage, etc). He does not give a second thought to rolling up his sleeves and fixing something himself. This is a blessing and a curse, of course, because sometimes what needs to be done falls into the realm of responsibility of someone else, but his intentions are always good and if people give him a chance they realize he's an immense force for positive change.</p>

    <p>Kennedy is quite possibly the hardest-working guy that I know. While I'm quite the "hare," he is the tortoise. But even that doesn't give him enough credit -- this man is absolutely relentless. Day-in and day-out, the bulk of his hours seem to go to work. Yet he never seems to burn out. There's nothing that gets between him and his work.</p>
    <p>Since I met him in 2011, he's been continously building his portfolio and growing his following. He's one of the few designers I know that has fans come up to him and ask for photographs! Don't let his humility fool you ("I only make things look pretty!") -- Kennedy designs functional, usable apps with the best of them. To me, it's no wonder that his steady, consistent work has earned him both a studio of workers (Theron) the opportunity to work with some of the most prestigious firms in the world (Google, et al.). Kennedy has moved quickly from a dead start to the pinnacle of his field and he's not showing any sign of slowing down. Keep your eyes on this one.</p>

    <p>Thanks again for speaking at graduation today. Your genuine advice was exactly what the students needed to hear. It was really great and I'm glad you stuck around afterward (hope this means you were having a good time! I know the grads appreciated the chance to talk with you).</p>

    <p>Without hesitation I can tell you that I was thoroughly and completely satisfied with your uber-professional work: you were creative, responsive and produced <a href="/smedresmanlaw/">a great website</a> for me. Going into the project I was hoping for something a bit less stuffy than the standard lawyer's website. You shot a bullseye. It was truly beyond my expectation, as it's both fresh and succinct. If you ever need a recommendation please call me and I'll be very happy to speak enthusiastically of your good work. Thanks again for everything.</p>

    <p>Kennedy is amazing. He is very fast, and has great attention to detail. He takes as much pride in things that are invisible to the user, as he does with things that are visible to the user. He rebuilt our Galoremag.com site in about 3 weeks by himself, when a team of consultants were telling us it was a 6 month job.</p>
