        <!-- <p>I am Kennedy, a naively optimistic entrepreneur. When I am not building my own products I am hired as a UX strategist &amp; mobile UI designer. I live full time in NYC, but I can often be found in SF for my clients out West. My side hobby is real estate, so I occasionally spend time in Florida near where I grew up. When I am not working I enjoy spending time surfing, motorcycles, eating cookies, continuing my self-education, and drinking coffee.</p> -->
        <p>Kennedy is a Senior UX Designer at the intersection of products and services. He has had the opportunity to work with powerful brands such as Google, WeWork, Citi, IBM, Wine Spectator, Porsche, Spotify, Victoria's Secret, and MLB.</p>
