        <p>Circly will help you, your friends, and family lower your risk of breast cancer. Tell us a little about yourself so we can understand what your risks are.</p>
        <p>With some friends we built Circly at the Code vs. Cancer hackathon. Big thnks to <a href="https://www.gyro.com/">gyro</a> for hosting this hackathon. Not only did we have a great time, but we won first place and took home a $10,000 cash prize thanks to <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a>. The goal of what we were trying to do was provoke a reaction to help share how important getting a breast exam is.</p>

      <h3>Wizard</h3>

    <c span=6 span-s=row>
      <p>The idea behind this was to collect your information along the way. We ended up building a pretty extensive website built in Python. The site would allow you to login, enter in your info, and invite your loved ones. One you did this you had a circle of trust that would relied on each other to ensure they were taking care of each other.</p>

      <p>We testest our idea on my mom. I sent her a quick nip pic to see what kind of reaction I would get out of her. To my suprize she was not even phased and actually thanked me.</p>
