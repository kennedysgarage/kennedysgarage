# [Kennedy's Garage](http://kennedysgarage.com)

Welcome to my Github repo. I figured I would toss my site up here so anyone could follow along and observe how I build most websites. If anyone has any questions feel free to reach out and ask.

## Making it work
* Start the local server ```jekyll serve --watch```
* Deploying ```rake deploy```

## Thanks
