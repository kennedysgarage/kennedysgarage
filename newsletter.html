    <h3>About The Newsletters</h3>
    <p>A few of you have suggested that I do this, so here I am. I don't plan on sending out that many email, honestly I will probable forget about this whole thing. I figure it might be better to break the emails apart, as my aunt could care less about tech stuff and so on. I will post examples once I send one out. Oh and of course I will never sell or spam you, should go without saying.</p>
