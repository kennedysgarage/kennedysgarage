          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>Mr. Kennedy was a website that built to keep friends and family up-to-date while my kid brother was having a liver transplant.</p>

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="ss-icon ss-standard">&#x2713;</i> Big Brother</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Website</h3>
          <!-- <p>We raised a total of $1,050 for the Liver Life Foundation.</p> -->
          <p>The first website I create was made within a few hours after sitting at the hospital. I was getting a lot of text, phone call, Facebook messages, etc. I figure I would bring all communication to one place. A few years later I redesigned the site to be more of a timeline to remember. </p>
