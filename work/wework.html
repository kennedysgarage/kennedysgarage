    <p class="intro">I joined WeWork as I have a passion for real estate, and there was a lot of room for growth. The cherry on top was the crossover between digital and physical design.</p>

    <p>This story began when I initially met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomersharon/">Tomer Sharon</a> at a Design Studio Methodology Workshop that he was teaching in 2013 while we were both employed at Google. Fast forward a few years, Tomer reached out to me to share his vision and his plans at WeWork. I could not be more excited. Tomer was a legend in my eyes. He was previouly on the Google Search team as a Senior User Experience Researcher. He also wrote the book titled <a href="https://amzn.to/2OZAlbM">It's Our Research: Getting Stakeholder Buy-in for User Experience Research Projects</a>. So naturally, I accepted a full-time role at WeWork as a Design Team Lead. I was his first hire, and we had a long road ahead of us.</p>

      <h3>Week One</h3>
      <p>We talked about what he is accomplished so far. The foundation for everything we were doing was around <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/why-i-couldn-t-say-i-joined-wework-after-i-left-google-5074fa340583">these User Journeys he identified</a>. Later these evolved to Pre-Membership, Onboarding, Membership, Growth, and Alumni.</p>

      <h3>Month One</h3>
      <p>We made an integral hire, Benjamin Gadbaw. He was hired to lead our service design. Quick side note, he is absolutely brilliant and an absolute pleasure to work with.</p>
