<p>Hey Gary,</p>

<p>I just wanted to say that it was a pleasure to see you twice this week. You’re an awesome speaker and have amazing energy. I would like to share a quick story with you.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated that you are everywhere all the time, and last night I remembered when I first noticed this. On January 29th, 2011 I went to a Starbucks to grab my normal iced coffee. At the time I was a huge Gowalla fan, and that day I happened to see that someone had dropped these awesome looking marbles. I picked them up, and Gowalla told me that they were dropped by you. Even though you didn’t physically hand them to me I still felt incredibly lucky that day. I can’t really explain why it made me so happy, but it did. <a href="https://twitter.com/KennedysGarage/statuses/31532205578653696">I tweeted it out immediately</a>, but unfortunately, I sucked at social media at the time and didn’t @ you. Thanks for dropping those marbles.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Kennedy</p>
