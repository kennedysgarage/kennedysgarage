<p>I figure I would share my results from taking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers-Briggs</a> test from <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/bgadbaw">Benjamin</a> wanted to see what types of personalities we were and how this knowledge could be used for the team-work within <a href="https://twitter.com/weworkux">WeWork UX</a> team. I have never taken this test before.</p>

<p>So I took the Personality Test as Benjamin had instructed and got the results back immediately. It said that I was <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/56eaedb591b9e">“The Debater” (ENTP-A)</a>. When I read the title I was a bit taken aback. I said there was no way that I was the Debater, whatever that meant. Then I thought, I was actually debating with myself whether I was the Debater or not. </p>

<h3>“The Debater” (ENTP-A)</h3>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Analyst<br/>
<strong>Strategy:</strong> People Mastery<br/>
<strong>Strength of individual traits:</strong> Extraverted: 75%, Intuitive: 61%, Thinking: 90%, Prospecting: 75%, Assertive: 81%.</p>

<p>I forget what Benjamin ended up doing with these results. I am sure we had some kind of a meeting about it where I must have been daydreaming. The point of sharing this with you is to show that knowing these things about yourself can be a great asset. As for me, I took it as a bit of an acceptance for who I am.</p>

<p>Don’t try to be something you are not. Accept who you are, try to fix the negative things of course, but own it and use who you are to your advantage.</p>
