<p>Noticed how I didn't title it "Focusing on one idea". I accepted a long time ago that I am not wired to focus on just one idea. In my 20's I thought I could do everything and I wanted to do everything. This is a common phase they all young entrepreneurs go through. I attempted to do a lot of things in my 20's. I was a mechanic on air planes, did ocean rescue, surf instructor, bartender, EMT in an emergency room, sold coffee, created my own startup, and a lot of little things in-between. There was a lot more that I wanted to do. I wasn't always successful, but I gave it my all. I don't regret bouncing around so much, I learned a lot and gained a lot of life experiences. All of this made me who I am today and I am proud of that.</p>

<p>Durning this time I generated a lot of ideas. Some good, some bad, and a few completely random ones. Recently something switched and I think I have figured out what I want my main focus to be. I have always known, but I now feel that I am ready to take on this part of my life.</p>

<p>Real estate is where my heart is. Everything about it makes me excited. I don't plan on becoming an agent to sell houses, although I do plan on getting my license to have a better understanding of that side of things. I want to learn as many pain points as possible and in the process invest in some properties. The goal of this is to build something out of it.</p>

<p>There is still a lot of self-education I want to explore before I switch over doing real estate full time. In the meantime I will continue building my <a href="http://theronstudios.com">creative studios</a> with my awesome co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/brianrevak">Brian Revak</a> and help our clients build their business through strategy and execute it with amazing design.</p>

<p>Because of my new focus I will be sharing my ideas that I don't plan on doing. I plan on sharing the details and any other assets that I might have come up with along the way. This is not going to be easy, but it's for the better and I hope some people can be inspired to build something great.</p>
