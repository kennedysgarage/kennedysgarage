<p>Here is your guide for woot.com. Woot is “is an online store and community that focuses on selling cool stuff cheap”. It is a great place to buy all kinds of things. Anything from a Bag of California Jumbo Premium Pistachios to an iRobot Roomba Sage for cheap, real cheap.</p>
<p>Normal Woot Day: They sell one item for a 24 hour period, until it is sold out. After this 24 hour period, whether the item is sold out or not, they will post a new item for the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Bouncing “I Want One!”:</strong> There are only a few left, so buy it now if you want one.</p>

<p><strong>Woot Off!:</strong> This lasts anywhere from 24 -72 hours and is a constant stream of great deals. During this time they will sell a Bag O’ Crap (maybe). When the bar is full (all orange) the deal just started. When the bar is empty (all white) the item is sold out.</p>

<p><strong>Bag O’ Crap:</strong> The Bag of Crap cost $1 + $5 for shipping. It is a random assortment of randomness. There is always one during a Woot Off! Example: Anything from a bag of Texas Air to 10 men’s Bulova Watches. Watch what people receive in there boc on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>2-for-Tuesday:</strong> This is where they offer 2 items for the price of one.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping:</strong> It cost $5 for shipping no matter how big or how many you buy.</p>

<h3>I have come up with some common questions that usually get asked in the member forums.</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many can I Buy?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> You can buy 1, 2, or 3 items and no more than that.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do the color squares mean next to my user name in the members forum?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> It is the number of times you have purchased.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear – 0 Woots</li>
  <li>Yellow – 1 Woot</li>
  <li>Orange – 2 Woots</li>
  <li>Blue – 3 to 10 Woots</li>
  <li>Dark Red – 11 to 25 Woots</li>
  <li>Black – 25+ Woots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If I completed a purchase, but it’s not on my “your account” page, does that mean that it didn’t go through?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes. Since there are lots of people that want to buy the same thing, the server might kick people off. So retry to buy the item until it shows up in “your account”</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> If you buy multiple items do you pay shipping for each one?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> No you pay $5 per a purchase. So if you buy 1, its $5. If you buy 2, it’s $5. If you buy 3, it’s $5.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What should I have in my signature?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> A lot of people put a itemize list of what they have bought or they put images of what they have bought.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I post a picture in the member’s forums?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> You have to know BBCode. [img class="aligncenter" ][/img class="aligncenter" ]<br/>
For example: [img class="aligncenter" ] http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif [/img class="aligncenter" ]</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What was sold in the past few days?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Simply click “the community”</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the best Woot Off items?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Woot monkey and Leak Frogs (but never talk about the Leak Frog)</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What gets you on probation?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> Bad manners</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What if someone spams the page with vulgar pictures?<br/>
<strong>A:</strong> 1: Right click the image<br/>

<h4>Update - 10/23/2016</h4>
<p>I forgot I published this years ago until I was trying to explain to a friend what a Woot was. Thanks to the WayBack Machine I found it here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101201194733/http://kennedysgarage.com/woot-explained/">https://web.archive.org/web/20101201194733/http://kennedysgarage.com/woot-explained/</a>. I decided not to edit the original post.</p>
