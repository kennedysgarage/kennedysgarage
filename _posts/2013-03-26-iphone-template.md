<p>I just got back from vacation and I took this photo while on the boat. I made it so it is super easy to replace the screenshot with yours. This will work with both iPhone 4 &amp; 5, but keep in mind the bottom half is cut off in the picture. Feel free to use it on any of your personal projects. Enjoy and have fun.</p>
