<p>I just got back from a little vacation / company retreat for <a href="http://theronstudios.com">Theron Studios</a> from Costa Rica. It was wonderful and much needed. In preparation for this trip I got my passport, <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck-application-program">TSA Pre&#x2713;&trade;</a>, and my <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/global-entry/about">Global Entry</a> card.</p>

<p>While going through customs and immigration at MCO I was able to skip the long line and go straight to the Global Entry kiosks. I scanned my passport, answered some quick questions, and took a photo.</p>

<p>As you can from the photo below the U.S. Government did not build this machine for tall people (I am 6'6") or little people. I know tall people don't normally bitch about accessibility for our height, but why should I have to lean down to get my whole face in the photo. When I approached the final station for getting back in the country the guy looked at the photo and then looked up at me and just rolled his eyes.</p>

<figcaption>I got caught taking a photo of this, the guy was more upset at me snapping the pic then my face not being in the photo. I think my smirk is progressing. Also, I love rocking my <a href="http://workingnotworking.com/">Working Not Working</a> shirt.</figcaption>
