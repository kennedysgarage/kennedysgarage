<p>Dear Recruiters,</p>
<p>Recently a few of you have reached out to inform me that you are offering $1,000 to refer someone for a role. I hate to break it to you but trust in my relationships is priceless.</p>
<p>I do know of a few people looking for jobs, but I will help them out only because I want to see them succeed. I love connecting people, and I am pretty good at it.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a complete dick; I am just saying that your approach sucks. No, I will not give you my contacts, but I will give you some of my time. Get to know me, build that relationship, let me gain your trust, show me that you are amazing at what you do.</p>
<p>I currently have a few recruiters that I would call close acquaintances at this point. I have had drinks with them, some conversations about tech, and an overall good time with them. Iâ€™m not saying take me on date, but do give me some respect.</p>
<p>Your future drinking buddy,<br/>Kennedy</p>
