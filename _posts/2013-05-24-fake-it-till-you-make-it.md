<p>Eventually you are going to actually fake it until you made it. Then what? I have been faking it my entire life. I have always lived by the motto "Fake it until you make it". It is something I said to myself to make myself feel better about the lack of formal education. Something I never thought about is what happens when I do "make it"? Let me till you, it's a very strange feeling.</p>
<p>I have been living (what feel like) a lie my whole life. I have literally bullshitting my why through life. I often question myself if the thing I am working on is just me bullshitting or actual skill that I developed.</p>
<p>Soon I realized or accepted that I was just a bullshit artists like everyone else. And more importantly, I accepted it. The world is mine and I can do whatever I want with it. I can make it happen.</p>
<p>My mother always said "Chris (she calls me by the first name) if we were ever to drop you off in a remote place, you would make it back home with more money then we left you with, more friends, and more stories then you had, to begin with."</p>
<p>Maybe it is not so much bullshit, but survival.</p>
