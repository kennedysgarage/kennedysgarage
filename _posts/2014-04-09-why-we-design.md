<p>I have been doing a lot of thinking on why people design things, including myself. I have boiled it down intro four main categories. Designing for yourself, designing for clients, designing for the greater good, and designing for money. I think a designer could (and should) fall under all these categories. I also think that each designer tends to do their job for one main category.</p>

<h3>Designing for Yourself</h3>
<p>Your main passion is just making awesome stuff to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Designing for Clients</h3>
<p>Your main passion is making the client happy.</p>

<h3>Designing for the Greater Good</h3>
<p>Your main passion is making the world a better place.</p>

<h3>Designing for Money</h3>
<p>Your main passion is cash in the bank.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong answer for who you are. For me having a better understanding of why I design helps gives a better direction for which projects I take on.</p>
<p>I understand we design for more than just the four categories mentioned above. The main goal was to boil the reasons down into the main points.</p>
