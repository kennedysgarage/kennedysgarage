<p>Yesterday "<a href="https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/web/4894818972.html">WEB DEVELOPER (DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES)</a>” received <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9063109">102 points on Hacker News</a>. One of the many highlights of what made this popular was the fact that for all that the job required it only paid $12/hour. It’s easy to laugh this off as pretty much anyone in this field makes a lot more while having a lot less experience. They may find someone, but hey they will get what they pay for, right?</p>

<p>Late last night my wife brought to my attention an ad for someone looking for babysitter to watch their four kids for $10 or less an hour. The only requirements are “must love children and be very dependable," oh and a “non-smoker." Not a lot skills required to be responsible for four little humans. I understand that companies have large budgets whereas most families do not, but it’s crazy to think of the type of people that would babysit four random kids for $10 an hour. My first thought was: I guess they will get what they pay for.

<p>I took this as a friendly reminder that <mark>my job is not that bad, and I get paid a shit ton more than I should for doing something that won’t kill anyone.</mark></p>
