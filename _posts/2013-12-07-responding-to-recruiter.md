<p>I will be the first to admit that I give recruiters a lot of shit, but I will also admit that a few of them are truly great at their job and have been a huge help. Most of the time it is just spam. I have received countless emails addressed to a different name and jobs that are not even close to what I do. Every once in a while, I will receive a well-written email or an email from a very large company. For the emails that are not spam I respond back with a generic email to at least touch base and say thanks. Here is a couple example that I actually use.</p>

<h3>Thanks, but not thanks</h3>

<p>Hey **|Name|**,</p>

<p>Thank you very much for reaching out to me. While I am a fan of **|Acme Co.|**, I'm currently not looking for new opportunities. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to contact me. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedysgarage">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kennedysgarage">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Again, thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Kennedy</p>

<h3>Thanks, but I can't relocate</h3>

<p>Hey **|Name|**,</p>

<p>Thank you very much for reaching out to me. While I am a fan of **|Acme Co.|**, I am not in a position to relocate at this time. Please do keep me in mind if anything should open in the future that you think I would be a good fit for. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedysgarage">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kennedysgarage">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to contact me.</p>

<p>Again, thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Kennedy</p>

<p>I like to keep the responses short and to the point. I am sure these recruiters have to read through a lot more emails than I do and their jobs depend on it. I do this to respect their time. I once decided that I would email a recruiter back to explain everything that was wrong with their email, long story short, I am now "blacklisted" from Turner Broadcasting System.</p>

<p>Now that you have this power please don't abuse it and become a dick like the recruiters you hate. Give them some respect, make sure your swap out the placeholders. Spell their name correct. Don't ask them to connect on Linkedin if that is where they emailed you from. Donâ€™t copy and paste from a bunch of different places so your font is a bunch of colors and different sizes. Be genuine, only say these things if you mean it. Be professional. You might be surprised how far a little common courtesy will go.</p>

<p>You can make your life a bit easier by enabling <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-in-labs-canned-responses.html">Canned Responses</a> in Gmail Labs. There are plenty of useful tutorials online that will hold your hand and show you how to set that up.</p>
