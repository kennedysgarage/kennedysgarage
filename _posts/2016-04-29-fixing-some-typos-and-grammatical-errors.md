<p>Any reader of mine knows that I am pretty much the worst at spelling and grammar. The sad part is that I will go over my writing a few times to make sure that there are no errors. There has never been a time where I’ve gotten it 100% correct. I normally have my good friend <a href="https://github.com/kennedysgarage/kennedysgarage/commits/master?author=brianrevak">Brian</a> or my other good friend <a href="https://github.com/kennedysgarage/kennedysgarage/commits/master?author=ilanasufrin">Ilana</a> edit the post either before or after I publish it, if they have the time.</p>
<p>Believe it or not I actually try really hard to improve my spelling and grammar. I understand that I am not the greatest at it, but at least I try. I never understood why people get upset when others call them out. OK, maybe they don’t do it in the most constructive way, but I love when people do it to me. I always hope to learn why and how they are able to point those mistakes out to me.</p>
<p>A couple days another good friend of mine, <a href="https://github.com/kennedysgarage/kennedysgarage/commits/master?author=ttimsmith">Tim</a>, helped me out without asking or even saying anything. Things like this make my day. I can not even express how happy this makes me. So, thank you, Tim. I really appreciate it. You can <a href="https://github.com/kennedysgarage/kennedysgarage/pull/7/commits/804dd71bc90be8976feca909c62da0be963a5792">view his suggested changes</a> on GitHub where my website code lives.</p>

<p>The next time someone corrects your spelling or grammar, say thank you and try to learn from it.</p>
