<p>You can always earn more money, but never more time. Time is always draining from our lives. You can never get time back.</p>
<p>Back in the day the stone masons used a twenty-four-inch gauge to measure and lay out their work. We can now use this tool as a way to teach us about the division of time and the right use of each day. The story goes that time could be broken down into three equal parts; eight hours for God, eight hours for labor, and eight for sleep.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about religion, but I don't know anyone that dedicated eight hours to God. My day is generally broken down into 16 hours for work, four hours for family, and four hours for sleep. I often end up spending, even more, time for work and even less for family and sleep. I'm not trying to brag about how many hours I put in. I do admit that I have a psychological issue that makes me want to put in that extra hour to be better than the next guy.</p>
<p>Time and I have always had our problems. I often have no concept of it. There are days where I will start on a project at 9:00am and the next thing I know it is 2:00am. Time is one of the few things that I hate about life. Maybe because I have no real control over it, just how I spend it. I have always wished for more hours in the day, but to be honest, I wound not spend them wisely, I would probably use all the extra working more.</p>
<p>Be wise with your time and really try to think about how you are spending it. Make sure you put a little aside for investing. Things such as family, education, traveling, and just plain living. Enjoy it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.&#8221;</p>
