<p>I want to share a little frustration that I recently rediscovered and it goes something like this.</p>

<p>I pull up to the gas station to find out that the outside credit card machine is not working. I go inside to pay, I get this nostalgic feeling of having to change the TV without a remote.</p>

<h5>Here is the gist of conversation</h5>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> I would like to fill it up.<br/>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> How much?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> All the way.<br/>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> How much is that?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> I have no clue, I just want to fill up the tank.<br/>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> How much do you normally pay?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> What does that matter, I just want to fill up my tank.<br/>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> So how much do you want to put in?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> OK, how about $2,000 just to make sure it's filled up.<br/>
<strong>Clerk:</strong> (They look at me as if I am some kind of smart ass.)<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> Fine just put $20 in it.</p>

<p>I normally don't like to post problems when I don't have a solution, but I am afraid I don't understand how gas station payment systems work. There has to be a better solution.</p>
