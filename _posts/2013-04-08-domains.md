<p>I'm not looking to make enough money to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kU53Cxi.gif">dive in a pool of coins</a>, but it would be nice to pay myself back for holding the domains, like a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K6HNDHe.gif">Cat Crossbow</a>. Some of them I have a twitter handle and even designs.</p>
