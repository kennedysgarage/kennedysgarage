<p>Last night I was chatting with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/peignoir">Franck</a> about life. One of the talking points he brought up was how bacon and eggs came to be. I love hearing stories like this. Another good one is how the ad agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._W._Ayer_%26_Son">N.W. Ayer</a> designed and executed a marketing strategy for De Beers to make diamonds the symbol of engagement rings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;To create a situation where almost every person pledging marriage feels compelled to acquire a diamond engagement ring.&rdquo;</p>
  <small>- N.W. Ayer (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/fashion/weddings/how-americans-learned-to-love-diamonds.html">according to New York Times</a>)</small>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, Franck was telling me about how Edward L. Bernays was hired by Beech-Nut to help sell bacon and that I should watch the video myself. I would like to share that video with you.</p>

<p>Edward says that the newspaper throughout the country that had the headlines that said: "4,500 physicians urge heavy breakfasts in order to improve the health of the American people". I decided to do a quick search to see if anyone else found any archives from old newspapers and I came up empty handed. So, I searched for myself and found an article in the Schenectady Gazette from August 21, 1922, with the headline "<a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19220831&id=y00hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HoIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4608,5199245&hl=en">Physicians urge a heavy breakfast</a>".</p>

<p>It's amazing how things like this come to be. Sometimes it's nice to stop and think about why we do thing in life.</p>
