<p>We have all seen Venus flytrap, some of you might have owned one at some point. They devour flys while sucking up the sun. I am thinking that we could cook a few of these up and sell them as the centerpiece on a nice salad. We could have three options: vegetable, fruit, and meat. This would make the perfect food truck in NYC. Target people that are looking for something unusual for lunch. I would try it.</p>

<p class="note">This is something that was nothing more than a random idea. I did zero research.</p>
