<p>One of the most repetitive tasks that I do on my mobile devices is enter in my username and email address. I noticed a lot of people still typing each character in. I would share how to make your life a little more efficient. On both iPhone and Android devices you can setup keyboard shortcuts. I have the following saved in my settings.</p>

<p><strong>kg</strong> = kennedysgarage<br/>
<strong>kg@</strong> = kennedysgarage@gmail.com</p>

<p>So when I type "kg" it will automatically change to "kennedysgarage". I have also setup shortcuts for my other usernames that I use frequently.</p>
