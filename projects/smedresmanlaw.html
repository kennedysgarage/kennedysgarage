    <p>We love making our clients happy. We also love when they bring us whiskey. It truly was a pleasure working with Mr. Smedresman. He is an ideal client that gave us the chance to use our clean styling to redesign his firm's site.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Without hesitation I can tell you that I was thoroughly and completely satisfied with your uber-professional work: you were creative, responsive and produced a great website for me. Going into the project I was hoping for something a bit less stuffy than the standard lawyer's website. You shot a bullseye. It was truly beyond my expectation, as it's both fresh and succinct. If you ever need a recommendation please call me and I'll be very happy to speak enthusiastically of your good work. Thanks again for everything.&rdquo;</p>
