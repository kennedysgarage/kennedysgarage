        <p>&ldquo;Without hesitation I can tell you that I was thoroughly and completely satisfied with your uber-professional work: you were creative, responsive and produced a great website for me. Going into the project I was hoping for something a bit less stuffy than the standard lawyer's website. You shot a bullseye. It was truly beyond my expectation, as it's both fresh and succinct. If you ever need a recommendation please call me and I'll be very happy to speak enthusiastically of your good work. Thanks again for everything.&rdquo;</p>
