  <p>Circly will help you, your friends, and family lower your risk of breast cancer. Tell us a little about yourself so we can understand what your risks are.</p>
  <p>With some friends we built Circly at the Code vs. Cancer hackathon. Big thnks to <a href="https://www.gyro.com/">gyro</a> for hosting this hackathon. Not only did we have a great time, but we won first place and took home a $10,000 cash prize thanks to <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a>. The goal of what we were trying to do was provoke a reaction to help share how important getting a breast exam is.</p>

    <p>The idea behind this was to collect your information along the way. We ended up building a pretty extensive website built in Python. The site would allow you to login, enter in your info, and invite your loved ones. One you did this you had a circle of trust that would relied on each other to ensure they were taking care of each other.</p>
