      <h3>I need your help</h3>
      <p>The bus will leave from NYC and arrive in Austin a few days later. From start to finish it is going to cost a pretty penny. Right now I am guessing it is going to cost me around $800. I am trying to raise money to help cover some of the cost. The most expensive part is going to be the plain ticket back, but the day to day living expense is going to add up quick.</p>

    <section id="history">
      <h3>Let's take a look back</h3>
      <p>I was on the 2011 StartupBus with Team <a href="kennedysgarage.com/projects/lemonade-stand">Lemonade Stand</a>. We crafted a neighborly mobile commerce platform that enables people to buy and sell goods within a community. We opened the pathway for such companies such as <a href="https://www.zaarly.com">Zaarly</a> and the dozen others that pop up after us. We had over 30 articles written up about us that eventually lead us to be techcrunched. All the hard worked help the team reach the semifinals, finishing in the top 12 of 38 teams. When we got back home we were honored with Hack of the Month at NY Tech Meetup. Keep in mind that we only had 48 hours to build our product and everything else that goes with the territory, crazy how much a dedicated team can complete in such a short time.</p>
